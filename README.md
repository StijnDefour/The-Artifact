# The Artifact

# The Assignment
Dear Developers,

We have deployed a team of secret agents in hostile areas. We deploy packages with weapons, gadgets and supplies by airplane. The locations of those packages are top secret and cannot fall into enemiesâ€™ hands. This is where you come in. We need a secure application through which we can share the location of the secret supplies. Some supplies are available to all of our secret agents and some supplies are only available to certain agents. The backend to communicate through is located here. Note that radio connectivity is not always available at the location of the supplies and our agents should be able to locate the packages without relying on internet connectivity. Our agents should also be able to communicate the information of supplies physically through a QR code or other means. Also note that our agents can be captured. Their mobile devices can also be stolen. A stolen or lost device should not lead to compromised data, so take the right security measures.

We depend on your expertise to make the optimal decisions on how to visualise and navigate to supplies. Try to be creative.

The success and fate of our operation lies in your hands.

Good luck,

With kind regards, 
The Hack the Future Mobile Challenge team+
